# Grid

A clone of an old game where you grow regions until a certain portion is owned. Enemies try to destroy your new path killing the player and resetting the grid. All data is expressed as nodes in a graph instead of a grid so everything is handled as a graph and polygons as opposed to the solution using a grid in memory allowing for nice effects later when the base gameplay is done.

This version is playable but lacks any progression and is not fully functional yet.
